<h1>About Me (or, in other words, who is William Tostes?)</h1>
<p>Hello! Thanks for visiting my first website, which was created in August 2023 as one of the introductory activities from "The Complete 2023 Web Development Bootcamp", held by the instructor Dr. Angela Yu.</p>

<p>I'm a 32 years old Brazilian, born in the beautiful city of Rio de Janeiro. Nowadays, I'm living in Porto, Portugal, for the last 3 years.</p> 
<p> I live with my Fianc√©e since 2022 and we are happy to inform that we will get married in the next few months.</p>

<p>Even though I finished my studies in the Business Management, Service Engineering and Industrial Engineering areas, I've always worked with Information Technology, since my first graduation internship in 2014. </p>
  
<p> Since 2018, I've been working as a Business Analyst in the most variety of projects, sectors and countries, helding activies like analysis of Business Requirements and development/prioritization of functional/technical requirements, for example. As a senior BA, I was also responsible for the leadership of a 4 developers' team, focused on the development of changes related to SAS application system. </p>

<p> Now, I'm doing a career switch for the Web Development area, which I'm sure is the perfect next step for my career and I have great expectation that I will generate more value creating websites and application, taking advantage of my extensive background in the functional areas.  </p>
